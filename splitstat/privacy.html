    <h3>SplitStat Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Updated April 2022<br><a href="mailto:hi@thatalex.dev">hi@thatalex.dev</a></p>

    <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>The SplitStat Bot is a Discord bot developed by <a href="https://thatalex.dev" target="_blank">Alex</a>. This bot is not affiliated with <a href="https://tracker.gg" target="_blank">Tracker.gg</a> nor <a href="https://splitgate.com" target="_blank">Splitgate/1047 Games</a>.<br>
            Throughout this document, The SplitStat Bot will be referred to by the terms "we, our, us, the Service" or "SplitStat Bot".</p>
    <h3>What data is collected?</h3>
        <p>Below is a list of data we collect, why we collect it, and what is done with it.<br>
        <ul> 
            <li style="font-size:20px;">IGNs (In-Game Names) - Used to find your player profile via Tracker.gg's API. Only used to make a web request, never stored on the Service's end.</li>
            <li style="font-size:20px;">Player Platforms - Used to find your player profile via Tracker.gg's API. Only used to make a web request, never stored on the Service's end.</li>
            <li style="font-size:20px;">Discord Display Name (username#1234) - Logged in errors & used to identify misuse of the Service</li>
            <li style="font-size:20px;">Discord Guild Name - Logged in errors & used to identify misuse of the Service</li>
        </ul>
        All data is collected within reason and can be withdrawn anytime by ceasing use of the Service.
    </p>
    <h3>How is the data used?</h3>
        <p>For select items (IGNs, Player Platforms), this is not stored locally and immediately used to request user profiles from Tracker.gg.<br>
        For Discord-provided items, like your username and guild, these are logged to the Service in order to prevent misuse of the Service and properly handle issues that may arise.<br>
        SplitStat does not disclose this information with any third-party platform unless required by law.</p>
    <h3>Can I refuse data collection?</h3>
        <p>You are free to refuse our data collection, however understand that the Service may not be able to provide some services.</p>
